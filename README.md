## About 
I am currently in a BS/MS Neural Engineering program at the University of Miami.
Throughout my time as an engineering student I have completed numerous coding 
projects including my Senior Design project. This project involved utilizing
MATLAB's machine learning algorithms to diagnose diabetic retinopathy and 
macular edema. I am currently working to improve my range of coding languages
and machine learning capabilities.
